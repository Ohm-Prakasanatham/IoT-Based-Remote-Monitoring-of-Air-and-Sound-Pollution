# Remote-monitoring-of-Air-and-sound-pollution-IOT

ABSTRACT:

As pollution increasing in our day to day life, we need to control pollution by keep tacking of the data of our surroundings. This project was designed to implement the Internet of things to monitor the Air pollution and Sound levels in the Environment. It can be done by using different types of sensors to collect data from the environment and give those details to us through smart devices like laptops and mobile phones via Internet. This project presents a system with a design and with low cost to monitor the data. As these sensors are connected to the internet, they can monitor data from any remote location without actually visiting it. Authorities can get alert messages if pollution exceeds, so they can take actions to control pollution.

LITERATURE SURVEY:

-- In 2011, Diego Mendez, Alfredo J. Perez, Miguel A. Labrador, Juan Jose Marron proposed air pollution monitoring system using GPS technology in mobile phones. It retrieves large amount of data easily and also cost effective.

-- In 2011, Wenhu Wang, Yifeng Yuan, Zhihao Ling introduced an air quality monitoring system based on ZigBee wireless sensing technology. It uses ZigBee wireless network to send data to people. If something happen and data exceed threshold value, it gives warning to them to take certain action.

-- Vikhyat from Delhi, had come up with a proposal environmental monitoring system called ArduAir which is a small and portable measurement system which includes various gas sensors and proposed software for collecting data from the ArduAir and plotting it in real-time.

-- In 2016, Navreetinder Kaur, Rita Mahajan proposed a Wireless sensor network (WSN) system which has some specific parameters of the environment such as temperature, humidity, CO2 etc and sends data to the base station through Zigbee pro.

PROPOSED SYSTEM:

We developed this System to monitor Air pollution as well as Sound levels lively using Iot technology. The data is collected from MQ gas sensor and sound sensor and send directly to the cloud using arduino with Esp wifi module and data is visualized in the form of graphs and charts. MQ 135 sensor is used to sense gases like ammonia, benzene, CO2, Smoke etc. The objective of this system is continuous monitoring of the pollution levels which is beneficial to all.
Proposed system consists of sensors and Arduino connected to them. Initially the Arduino board is provided with a 5V DC supply through adapter or USB cable. Then Sensors are connected to Arduino and ESP8266 WiFi module is connected to make it connect to the Internet.

COMPONENTS:

Arduino UNO, MQ-135 Sensor, Sound Sensor, ESP 8266 WiFi Module.
Software: 
Arduino IDE, ThingSpeak Cloud platform.
